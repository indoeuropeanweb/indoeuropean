                    <p class="lead text-justify" style="text-align: justify">
                        Private universities do charge tuition fees, but they remain significantly lower than their counterparts in other developed countries.

                        Germany also provides excellent scholarship opportunities that make it financially feasible for Indian students to study abroad. Programs like the <span style="font-weight: bold">DAAD Scholarships</span> specifically cater to international students based on academic merit. Others include:
